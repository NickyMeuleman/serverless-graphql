## Update

On <time datetime="2020-03-12">12 March 2020</time> I prevented the
serverless functions from running in production.

**This changes nothing about the validity of the accompanying
blogposts.**
They cover the entire process of setting up the endpoint.

To view the code of this site when serverless functions were enabled,
check out [the repository at the last state with serverless functions enabled](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/serverless-graphql/tree/dc3916542a7400db9bcf5a3dd404aaddb08793b8)
